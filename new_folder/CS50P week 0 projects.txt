In the past few days, I focused on Week 0 of the CS50P course.
I first took time to understand key foundational concepts such as:

Visual Studio Code for CS50
Functions
Variables
Return Values
Side Effects
String Methods

Once I felt confident with these topics, I went ahead and completed all the Week 0 projects, which include:
1.Indoor Voice
2.Playback Speed
3.Making Faces
4.Einstein
5.Tip Calculator
